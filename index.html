     <p class="jtrules">This is a red dunk card. While nobody is really sure what in the hell a red dunk card actually is, we can all agree on one thing... it's really red. And that's a good thing when you're the market for a red dunk card - that it be red. If it were a blue dunk card it wouldn't suit your red dunk card needs. That's why, if you're looking for a red dunk card, you've come to the right place. This is it!</p>
